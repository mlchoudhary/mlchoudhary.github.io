### [*Political Finance and Party Preferences*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4385015) 
 
Politiciansâ€™ influence depends on their relationships with other powerful politicians. In a network of elected representatives based on their committee assignments, I use network centrality as a measure of such influence. I use plausibly exogenous variation in funding to show that well-funded politicians tend to be more central. I also estimate the political parties' preferences over politicians' attributes and document that the parties place candidates with higher funding in more central positions than candidates with a stronger legislative record. This bias in favour of well-funded representatives is robust to other measures of influence such as their legislative productivity.

### *Bank Stress Tests* (Draft available soon) 
* with [Deepal Basak](https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/dbasak/home) and [Zhen Zhou](https://www.zhenzhoueconomics.com/)

Bank stress tests can be an effective information disclosure policy in persuading stakeholders to avoid *attacking* a bank, thereby decreasing the probability of bank failure during distress. This paper studies stress test design along two dimensions: strength and frequency, assuming stakeholders are privately informed and move sequentially. We characterize all robustly persuasive stress tests that ensure all bank stakeholders disregard private information and coordinate actions perfectly based on test results (*pass* or *fail*). Our findings indicate that more frequent stress tests can substitute for increased test strength in making the stress test result robustly persuasive. We then identify the optimal stress test policy and investigate how the optimal frequency and strength depend on macroeconomic conditions, bank idiosyncratic characteristics, and endogenous maturity choices of banks. Finally, we discuss how other regulatory measures may complement the stress test policy.
