I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student in Finance at London Business School. 



I work at the intersection of political economy and corporate finance. In my research, I explore how firms overcome political and contractual frictions in labour markets and its implications for the allocation of human capital. 


I am on the 2024-25 job market.
