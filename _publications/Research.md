title: "Political Finance and Party Preferences" 
abstract: Politiciansâ€™ influence depends on their relationships with other powerful politicians. In a network of elected representatives based on their committee assignments, I use network centrality as a measure of such influence. I use plausibly exogenous variation in funding to show that well-funded politicians tend to be more central. I also estimate the political parties' preferences over politicians' attributes and document that the parties place candidates with higher funding in more central positions than candidates with a stronger legislative record. This bias in favour of well-funded representatives is robust to other measures of influence such as their legislative productivity.
